Predicting Restaurant Survival Using Yelp Data and Machine Learning Techniques
Ao Huang and Xiru Pan

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of restaurants using a comprehensive dataset from Yelp, focusing on the highly turnover-prone restaurant sector. Traditional bankruptcy forecasting methods, which rely heavily on financial metrics, often fail to capture the nuances of small businesses like restaurants due to the scarcity of detailed financial data. By leveraging customer-generated reviews and various business attributes from Yelp, we intend to develop machine learning models to predict restaurant longevity, providing valuable insights for small business owners and enhancing the understanding of factors influencing business survival in the restaurant industry.
